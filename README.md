# fluidsynth2

Fluidsynth2 bindings for Go

This package allows you to interface with Fluidsynth using Go.

It's mostly based on the repo by [sqweek](https://github.com/sqweek/fluidsynth) with updates for Fluidsynth2 and additions to the API that allows for playback and not only note sending.

Check in examples to get the general gist on how to play a MIDI file.
